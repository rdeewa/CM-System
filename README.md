The Course Monitoring System is designed to streamline the process of monitoring courses within an educational organization. It assists system administrators in overseeing their infrastructure and provides an organized way to track the progress of multiple courses, batches, and faculty members.

In educational institutes where several courses run simultaneously, it becomes challenging for the Faculty Head to keep track of each course's daily progress. This system automates the process, maintaining records of all courses, batches, faculties, and daily updates, making it easier for the Faculty Head to manage and monitor the course plans effectively.

Key Features:-
User Authentication:

Basic authentication for different user accounts (Admin, Faculty).
Users can log in by providing the required credentials. After successful authentication, users can access their specific services.
Role-Based Access:

Admin: Responsible for registering faculty members and managing the system. Admins have the ability to create, update, view, and delete records.
Faculty: Faculty members can access their specific options once registered by the admin. They can view their assigned courses and update the status of each session in the course plan.
Course and Batch Management:

Admins can create and manage courses, batch schedules, and course plans.
Faculty members can update the day-wise status of each batch, keeping the course plan up to date.
CRUD Operations:

Both Admin and Faculty can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on records relevant to their roles.
Course Plan Maintenance:

Admins can create course plans, but only faculty members can update the status for each course, ensuring accurate tracking of the educational progress.

The system comprises five key entities:

Admin,
