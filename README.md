Course Monitoring Systems is used to monitor the course in an organization, and helps system administrators monitor their infrastructure.

In an educational Institute there are several courses running parallel every day. For every course there are several batches at same/different time. Every course has a session wise/day wise schedule. It will be difficult for the Faculty Head to know the status of every batch i.e. what is the session taught at each day in a batch.

So the Automated Course Monitoring System will keep the records of all the courses, batches, faculties and the day wise update for every batch. It will also help the faculty head to maintain the course plan.

there are five entities in Course Monitoring Systems i.e. Admin, faculty, Courses, Course-plan and Batch.

1. Basic authentication of various user accounts (admin, faculty).
2. User can log in by filling in the required credentials and after the authentication, the user can enjoy the services.
3. Both users have different options to perform. Admin can register faculty, and then faculty can access his/her options.
4. Here, admin and faculty perform CURD (create record, update the record, read/view this, and also can delete such.)
5. Admin can create course plan but only faculty can fill up the status for the course.
